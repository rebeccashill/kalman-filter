# kalman-filter
Kalman Filter program. Includes sensor fusion, filtering, and localization.

Sensor fusion = pulling information from multiple different sensor sources and unifying it to get the best estimate of your current state
Filtering = estimates unknown variables based on a series of measurements observed over time; necessary to get a better estimate of your current state because it's hard to get an accurate picture of what's going on
Localization = robots or vehicles determine their position in an environment using onboard sensors and algorithms; crucial for navigation & task execution
